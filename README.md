# Mixed Message
A message generator program that gives a random message everytime the user clicks on the button "click here".
## How it works
When the user clicks on the "click here" button, a random message is generated. It includes :
- A random date
- A random action
- A random character / celebrity
- A random place
- A random weather
## Technologies
This program has been built using plain Vanilla Javascript.

The web page is done using HTML5.

I've used CSS to build the responsive design.
